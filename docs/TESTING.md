# Testing strategy

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#verification) owns required commands.

## Current setup and test locations

Use JUnit 4, coroutines-test, Robolectric/Compose Testing and Hilt/Room device tests.
Review images exist; golden comparisons and system-UI automation are not configured.

Screen tests and previews follow the fixed-display scope in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#visual-language), not a multiple-resolution device matrix.
Retain reference content, AAOS compatibility density, enlarged text and IME resizing.
Review fixtures use the current [Figma content bounds](ui/README.md): 2560 × 1184,
1792 × 829 at compatibility density, and 2560 × 940 with the reference IME.
Robolectric qualifiers describe the host, not necessarily the content bounds:
a 2560 × 1248dp host leaves 1184dp after its 64dp decor inset; 1792 × 893dp
leaves 829dp. Decor-free shell tests use content sizes directly. The shell inset
test dispatches 76/96px, then 96/160px system bars and restores them in one run;
this does not replace OEM window/Popup and native IME verification.
Isolated component and synthetic motion tests may use smaller fixtures; these do
not imply support for additional display sizes. CI's physical display is defined
in [cstd.ini](../.github/avd/cstd.ini).

Tests live in the subject module's `src/test`; device tests use `src/androidTest`.
Debug-only behavior uses `src/testDebug`. Two shared source sets need explicit wiring:

- `app/src/journeyTest`: connection journeys run on Robolectric and devices via
  [app/build.gradle.kts](../app/build.gradle.kts).
- `core-database/src/migrationTest`: populated V3 migration contracts use local and
  device wrappers. Other test directories are not automatically shared.

## Writing tests

- Test behavior in the owning module/package. Construct subjects directly; use
  Hilt for integration and fresh, controllable fakes for external dependencies.
  Keep helpers out of production APKs.
- Use `runTest`, a shared scheduler and injected clocks. Virtual time does not
  advance a separate clock. Install/reset Main locally; retain real Main on devices.
- Observe pending states and cover cancellation/late results. Close databases,
  cancel jobs and restore dispatchers after tests.
- Verify transactions, constraints, concurrency and rollback with real Room.
  Test persistence by reopening files and migrations with populated schemas;
  destructive reset is not migration coverage.
- Exercise Compose callbacks, Back, focus and enabled state through semantics.
  Use screenshots for layout, not as proof of persistence or provider behavior.

## Final Figma visual acceptance

After the final UI change, compare affected states with full-resolution
[v5 exports](ui/README.md), matching data, window size and display/font scale.
Compare app content without exported system bars or Debug controls. Inspect artwork,
typography/wrapping, geometry, colors, icons, insets and touch bounds. Also check
enlarged text and the actual AAOS content window, including focus, recovery and
interrupted motion.

Record references, review images and unresolved differences in the PR. Missing
references remain explicit. Builds, behavioral tests and generated images do not
establish visual parity. SVG-only renames require XML/render and byte-preservation checks.

## Current requirement map

These are existing suites, not execution results. Update critical mappings when
behavior changes; keep implementation gaps in [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#planned-features).
Related suites share the linked module/package; test names define individual cases.

## Integration boundaries

- Room migration fixtures cover populated V1 and original/expanded V3 upgrades and
  reopening, not a separately populated V2 fixture or `MigrationTestHelper`.
- [JourneyTestModule](../app/src/journeyTest/java/com/monsters/mobimon/testing/JourneyTestModule.kt)
  uses real MainActivity, ViewModels and repositories, in-memory Room, isolated
  DataStore and fake external providers. It never contacts GitHub or accesses user credentials;
  Debug previews also establish no provider or vehicle verification.
- Recreation, file reopening and process restart are distinct. Local tests, APK
  assembly and `NO-SOURCE` tasks do not prove device execution, live providers,
  Release behavior or launcher support. Real OAuth approval/restart/revocation and
  AAOS restriction/reconnection behavior need separate target-device verification.
  Copilot wire fixtures do not establish live account entitlement, OAuth-app access,
  model availability or compatibility with the experimental private endpoints.
- Driving tests cover supplied formulas and transaction invariants, not trusted
  driving evidence, real occurrence identity or evaluator-to-award agreement.
  Hungry/sick rendering and on-device decorative lifecycle still lack acceptance.

Record revision and device image/signal source with the
[required check report](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#verification).
Keep credentials and private logs out of reports.

## Focused commands and reports

Use `--tests <qualified-name>` with the owning module's `testDebugUnitTest`, or
`test` for plain Kotlin. Filtered tasks do not execute dependency suites or devices.
Kover: `./gradlew :app:koverHtmlReportDebug :app:koverXmlReportDebug` (local JVM only; no percentage gate).
[CI](../.github/workflows/android-ci.yml) owns artifact paths and retention.

### CI AAOS environment

The [workflow](../.github/workflows/android-ci.yml) and [cstd.ini](../.github/avd/cstd.ini)
define the image, extension, ABI and display. The workflow builds and installs the
[system bars overlay](../.github/avd/system-bars-overlay/AndroidManifest.xml) on its
disposable writable AVD, then checks the 96px top and 160px bottom bars with
[check-aaos-system-bars.sh](../scripts/check-aaos-system-bars.sh). Run the required
[host check](../scripts/check-aaos-environment.sh) and canonical device tests after
the overlay check. Use emulator 35.1.9 or newer.

For a persistent local AVD, install Python 3, JDK 17, SDK Platform 34, Build
Tools 34.0.0, `debugfs` and `e2fsck`. Install the official AAOS 34-ext9 Google
APIs revision 5 image matching the host ABI. Create a standard AAOS AVD at
2560x1440 / 160 dpi, then set `ANDROID_HOME`, `TEMPLATE_AVD` and `IMAGE_DIR`
to the local SDK, template AVD and output paths. Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_aaos_baked_image.py \
  --sdk-dir "$ANDROID_HOME" \
  --template-avd-config "$TEMPLATE_AVD/config.ini" \
  --output-image-dir "$IMAGE_DIR" \
  --avd-name mobimon_baked_bars_34
```

Use `--help` for nondefault AVD homes and host path conversion. Start the new
AVD in Device Manager, fully stop and restart it, then run
`bash scripts/check-aaos-system-bars.sh`. Set `ADB` or `ANDROID_SERIAL` if needed.
The image stays at `IMAGE_DIR` outside Git; the template AVD can be removed
after verification.

CI uses a fresh, headless AVD with software rendering and disabled animations.
Local CSTD images are separate inputs; matching metadata does not establish
identical binaries/services. The host check identifies the environment, not test execution.
